# Changelog

## [0.1.8]

- Terminal now properly renders full-screen TUI applications like OpenCode
- Fixed terminal content disappearing and scroll back being lost when opening a task. Terminals are now created proactively for each agent instead of connecting mid-session, which preserves full scroll back and content rendering. This is especially important for rendering TUI apps like Codex and Droid correctly.
- Improved terminal rendering quality, inspired by VS Code's xterm and node-pty implementation. Noticeably higher FPS, smoother scrolling, and a more native look and feel for terminal emulators.

## [0.1.7]

- When a task prompt mentions creating tasks (e.g. "break down into tasks", "create 3 tickets", "split into cards"), Kanban now shows a setup dialog offering to install the Kanban MCP before the task starts
- Similar setup dialogs appear for Linear and GitHub CLI when task prompts reference those services
- MCP server instructions now guide agents to detect the ephemeral worktree path and pass the main worktree as projectPath, so "add tasks in kanban" tasks correctly create tasks in the main workspace instead of the ephemeral task worktree

## [0.1.6]

- Show live hook activity (tool calls, file edits, command runs) on task cards as agents work
- Auto-confirm Codex workspace trust prompts so tasks start without manual intervention
- Show working copy changes in the detail panel's git history
- Fix terminal pane state bleeding across tasks when switching between them
- Fix duplicate paste events in agent terminals
- Stop detail terminals when trashing tasks to free resources
- Automatically pick up new versions when launching with `npx kanban`
- Fix git metadata not updating reliably when switching projects
- Stabilize workspace metadata stream startup

## [0.1.5]

- Added Droid CLI agent support alongside Claude and Codex
- Dogfood launcher for quickly opening Kanban on its own repo with runtime port selection
- Terminal rebuilt around xterm and node-pty for better performance and reliability
- Filter terminal device attribute auto-responses from being sent to agents as input
- Fix workspace metadata causing unnecessary rerenders, with retry recovery
- Fix task worktrees being recreated when the base ref updates if they already exist
- Fix self-ignored directories being symlinked in task worktrees
- Fix bypass permissions toggle resetting unexpectedly
- Fix git refs not clearing when switching detail scope

## [0.1.4]

- Each task gets its own CLI agent working in a git worktree, so they can work in parallel on the same codebase without stepping on each other
- When an agent finishes, review diffs and leave comments before deciding what to merge
- Commit or open a PR directly from the board, and the agent writes the commit message or PR description for you
- Link tasks together to create dependency chains, where one task finishing kicks off the next, letting you complete large projects end to end
- "Automatically commit" and "automatically open PR" toggles give agents more autonomy to complete work on their own
- MCP integration lets agents add and start tasks on the board themselves, decomposing large work into parallelizable linked tasks
- Built-in git visualizer shows your branches and commit history so you can track the work your agents are doing
